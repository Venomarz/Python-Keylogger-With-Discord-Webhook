This is python keylogger which uses a discord webhook to sent over the data.
The reason why this one is so special, is because of how to code works. Whenever someone types a backspace in a password for example like this: 
CoffeeDispenser2007, but he/she meant CoffeeDispenser2010, he/she does a few backspaces and then types the final word. 
Whenever a space is hit it sends the caracter between the spaces. 
Please change the webhook URL to make it work.
